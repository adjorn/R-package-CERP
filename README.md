# Implement  classification by ensembles from random partitions(CERP) to write an R-package.
#	Designed an algorithm to partition features into several groups and applied recursive algorithm to find out the best partition by using Leave One Out cross validation and confusion matrix. Applied simple ensemble to form the final model.
#	Compared CERP algorithms with other algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic regression) based on the models using a genetic data set and evaluated these models with ROC and classification error rate. The model using CERP algorithm is the best.
